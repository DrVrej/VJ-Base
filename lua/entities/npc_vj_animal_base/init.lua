				AllowCorpse -- Should it allow corpse to spawn?
				DeathAnim -- Should it allow death animation?
			--/// Implementing it \\\--
				1. Let's use type DeathAnim as an example. NOTE: You can have as many types as you want!
				2. Put a comma next to return. 		===> return true,
				3. Make a table after the comma. 	===> return true, {}
				4. Put the type(s) that you want.	===> return true, {DeathAnim=true}
				5. And you are done!
				Example with multiple types:		===> return true, {DeathAnim=true,AllowCorpse=true}
